This project consists of a backend (Python) and a frontend (React/TypeScript).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Backend Setup and Run

1.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project and install the required Python packages.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    From the root directory, execute the backend script.

    ```bash
    python run_backend.py
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup and Run

    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    Install the necessary npm packages for the frontend.

    ```bash
    npm install --force
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port. Open your browser to this address to view the application.
